# My Resume in LaTeX

This repository contains my resume in LaTeX format, using the custom class `twentysencondcv.cls`. The goal is to generate a professional and optimized PDF that highlights my experience and skills.

## Contents

- **`main.tex`**: The main LaTeX file that defines the content of my resume.

- **`my_cv.pdf`**: Final PDF version of the resume.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing information about the repository and usage instructions.

## How to Compile

To compile the `main.tex` file and generate the PDF, you can follow these steps:

1. **Locally**:
   - Ensure you have a LaTeX editor and a compiler like TeX Live or MikTeX installed.
   - Download the repository files and run `pdflatex main.tex` in your terminal, or use an editor like TeXstudio or Visual Studio Code with the LaTeX Workshop extension.

2. **Using Overleaf**:
   - Upload the `main.tex` and `twentysencondcv.cls` files to a new project on Overleaf.
   - Compile the project to generate the PDF.

## Customization

If you would like to use this repository as a template for your own resume, feel free to modify the `main.tex` file with your personal information and experience. Make sure to adjust the sections according to your needs and skills.
